## ðŸ“Š Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values and corrected inconsistencies in fields such as `source_name` and `destination_name`.
   - Converted timestamps into usable date-time formats for time-based analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed route types (`FTL`, `Carting`) and their impact on delivery time and distance.
   - Investigated correlations between `osrm_time`, `actual_time`, and `segment_actual_time`.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Derived new features such as:
     - **Delivery Efficiency**: Ratio of `actual_time` to `osrm_time`.
     - **Deviation Factor**: Difference between `actual_distance_to_destination` and `osrm_distance`.
     - **Trip Duration**: Derived from `od_start_time` and `od_end_time`.
   - Binned continuous variables (e.g., `actual_distance_to_destination`) for categorical analysis.

4. **Insights Generation**:
   - Identified key factors contributing to delayed deliveries.
   - Highlighted route optimization opportunities based on `segment_osrm_time` and `segment_actual_time`.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- **Route Type**:
  - **FTL** shipments consistently have shorter delivery times compared to **Carting**.
  - **Carting** shipments experience delays due to multiple stops and higher `segment_actual_time`.
- **Distance and Time**:
  - Discrepancies between `osrm_time` and `actual_time` highlight potential inefficiencies in routing or traffic estimation.
- **Geographical Patterns**:
  - Specific source-destination pairs have consistently higher deviations in delivery times, suggesting optimization opportunities.
